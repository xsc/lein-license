# lein-license

__lein-license__ is a [Leiningen][leiningen] plugin for project-level license
management, i.e. mainly for setting or updating a project's license information
in:

- the `LICENSE` file,
- the `README`,
- as well as the `project.clj`.

__Use cases__ thus include:

- setting the initial license for your Leiningen project if the EPL does not fit
  your needs,
- automatically updating e.g. authors, emails and copyright notices in your
  license files,
- as well as completely and seamlessly switching between licenses.

It utilises the data provided by [choosealicense.com][choosealicense] to
generate the license text. Make sure to visit that page if you're unsure (or
never thought of) which license suits your project best!

## Artifact

__Leiningen__ ([via Clojars](https://clojars.org/lein-license))

Add the following to your `:user` profile's  `:plugins` vector in
`~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lein-license/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lein-license)

## Usage

### Set &amp; Update a License

After you've decided on which license to use ([see below](#list-licenses)),
backup your changes (you never know) and pass the license identifier to the
`update` task, e.g.:

```
lein license update mit
```

(Have a look at `lein help license update` for the available options.)

If you've already run the above command once, you can update the license text
(e.g. with the current year, new author, ...) by simply issuing:

```
lein license update
```

The output will indicate progress:

```
License: MIT License
* updating project.clj ...
* updating LICENSE ...
* updating README ...
License updated.
```

For `README` updates, note the following:

- only `README.md` and `README.markdown` are currently supported,
- if it contains a block starting with `## License` it will be updated.
- short licenses will be inlined into the `README`, longer ones will be linked
  to by a copyright notice.

In the `project.clj` a `:license` map will either be inserted or updated. Note
that a `:key` value will be added for lein-license to be able to identify the
current license.

### List Licenses

To list all licenses provided by [choosealicense.com][choosealicense] and thus
this plugin, run:

```
lein license list
```

You can also filter using a prefix, e.g.:

```
lein license list gpl
```

The resulting output will look like the following:

```
  2 License(s) found:

      gpl-2.0          (http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0)
      gpl-3.0          (http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0)

  Visit http://choosealicense.com for a comprehensive overview
  and comparison of these licenses.
```

Note that the license list is cached in `$LEIN_HOME/.licenses.edn` to prevent
hitting of the rate limit set by Github's API (which is used to retrieve the
license list from the repository `github/choosealicense.com`).

### Preview/Render a License

To see what a license would look like using the currently available information,
pass its identifier to:

```
lein license render <identifier>
```

This will print the license text to your console.

## License Data

You can add some additional information to the `:license` map in your
`project.clj` which will be preserved in updates and used for rendering the
license:

```clojure
  :license {:author "Steve"
            :email  "steve@steve.steve"
            :year   2013}
```

`:author` and `:email` will be used directly in the license text, while `:year`
(if given) will cause the copyright notice to contain e.g. `2013-2015` instead
of just the current one.

You can, of course, also set this information in your global `:user` profile.

## Git Integration

If you're using Git and the configuration values `user.name` and `user.email`
are set correctly they will be used as default values for the license author and
email address.
